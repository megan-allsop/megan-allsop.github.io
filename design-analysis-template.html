Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

                <text>REPETITION: This website shows that the color palate is the same all through the homepage. The color is grey,
                    red, and off white. Both the header and footer are the same color. Even the typography is very similar
                    throughout the website. This is the repletion creates a flow and rhythm to the userâ€™s eyes. </text>

            <h3>Contrast &mdash;

            <p>
                <text>CONTRAST: Eagle pathways website has some contrast. The main contrast is the Logo on the top. The top has
                    a solid red header with eagle logo. This combo creates a very solid image at the top. The rest of the
                    web page is very open without any hash solid shapes. This contrast creates a vision of organization and
                    visual hierarchy. </text>
